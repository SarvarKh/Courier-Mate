# Courier Mate
Courier Mate is a web app that connects clients with couriers. Clients can post jobs and couriers can bid on those jobs. Once a courier is selected, they will pick up the package and deliver it to the client's destination.

## Features
- Post jobs: Clients can post jobs with a description of the package, the pickup and delivery locations, and the desired delivery date.
- Bid on jobs: Couriers can bid on jobs by specifying their price and the time they can deliver the package.
- Track jobs: Clients can track the status of their jobs, including the location of the package and the estimated delivery time.
- Rate couriers: Clients can rate couriers after their packages have been delivered.

## Getting Started
To get started with Courier Connect, you will need to create an account. Once you have created an account, you can post jobs, bid on jobs, and track jobs.
